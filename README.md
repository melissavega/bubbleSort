## COSC 2336 - Bubble Sort - Starting Out with C++

### Describe a Bubble Sort Algorithm, it's time complexity and show a C++ (or any other language) code example of Bubble Sort. 

The Bubble-Sort algorithm is an easy way to arrange data in an array in ascending or descending order. It starts by comparing the first two elements in an array. If element zero is greater than element one, they are exchanged. Then the second and third elements are compared and swapped if out of order. This process continues until the last two elements in the array are compared and exchanged if needed. 

**Worst and Average Case Time Complexity:** O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

**Best Case Time Complexity:** O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
